The game is a mutliplayer 2D game that involves controlling a single train compartment (block). Players should move the block in only 90 degrees by turing left or right and try to collect the coal (black block). As the players continue to collect coal, the number of compartments increases by one. The player that collect the maximum number of coal has the longest train and wins the level. If the train collide with one of its own compartments or with the game-board, then its GAME OVER!
