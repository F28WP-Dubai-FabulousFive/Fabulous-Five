SNAKE GAME IDEA

The game is a mutliplayer 2D game that involves controlling a single circle block (snake head). Players should move the block in only 90 degrees by turing left or right and try to eat the apple (red block). As the players continue to eat an apple, the snake grows in length by one block. The player that eats the maximum number of apples (has the longest snake) wins the level.this
